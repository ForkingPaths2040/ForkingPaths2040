### A Seat at the Table
 In June 2019, I had finished 6 years in the food and beverage industry realizing the lifestyle and mental stimulation was not meeting my expectations. Consequently, after discovering what skills I have acquired along with my strengths, the idea of software engineering as a career was planted! It was as if I finally found the missing puzzle piece. Coding is definitely a love/hate relationship, but ultimately, it wins everytime.  

Words of Affirmation is my love language. With code, this cycle of affirmation is repeated constantly. As most devs can relate, code either works or it doesn't. Once it does though, adrenaline kicks in, you affirm your skills, ego is boosted and motivation is gained. ADD. COMMIT. PUSH. 💚   

After GA's intense immersive program, I realized I became a part of an elite humble group of professionals. One that I am honored to particpate and contribute to. This is an industry where you earn your spot daily. Thus, I intend to have a seat at the table.
